He is chiefly remembered for scoring the last-minute goal which kept Carlisle United in the Football League in 1999, while on loan from Swindon Town. The drama of Glass's late goal, which came in one of only three games that he played for Carlisle, has since made it famous in English football at a level beyond its immediate ramifications.[2] Beyond the Carlisle goal, Glass's most notable time with a club was three seasons playing for AFC Bournemouth from 1996 to 1998, his only regular spell at a Football League club; he retired from football in 2001 aged 27. Glass had a journeyman's career in football, playing for many clubs, initially as a reserve keeper for Crystal Palace. He never played a first team game for the Eagles, but was an unused substitute several times, including the 1995 FA Cup semi-final replay against Manchester United, which Palace lost 2–0 at Villa Park. He was transferred to AFC Bournemouth a year later. The closest he came to a trophy in senior football was reaching the final of the Football League Trophy with Bournemouth in 1998 – Glass scored an own goal in the match, and Bournemouth lost 2–1. It was the last own goal scored at the old Wembley.[3] Glass moved to Swindon Town in the summer of 1998, but after falling out with the manager, Jimmy Quinn, was unable to gain a regular place in the team. He moved to Carlisle United on loan from Swindon late that season (after goalkeeper Tony Caig was sold to Blackpool and Richard Knight's loan period had been cut short due to injury). His moment of fame came on 8 May 1999, in the final match of the 1998–99 Third Division season against Plymouth Argyle, which Carlisle needed to win to avoid relegation. With the score 1–1 with only ten seconds remaining, and Carlisle winning a corner, Glass came up from his own penalty area and promptly scored a last minute goal, volleying the ball in after the Plymouth goalkeeper had parried out Scott Dobie's goalbound header. Carlisle got the win they needed and Scarborough were relegated to the Football Conference instead after a 1–1 draw with Peterborough United. Scarborough's match had already finished before Glass scored, and their fans had already been celebrating on the pitch at the McCain Stadium. So ... deep, deep, deep, I make it sixty seconds. Jimmy Glass knocks it long. It comes now to Bagshaw. Bagshaw back to Anthony. Up to Stevens ... and the ball goes out now for a corner to Carlisle United – will they have time to take it? Referee looks at his watch ... and here comes Jimmy Glass! Carlisle United goalkeeper Jimmy Glass is coming up for the kick – everyone is going up ... there isn't one player in the Carlisle half! Well, well ... and the corner kick comes in ... and ... the goalkeeper's punch ... oh ... Jimmy Glass! Jimmy Glass! Jimmy Glass, the goalkeeper, has scored a goal for Carlisle United! There's a pitch invasion! There is a pitch invasion! The referee has been swamped – they're bouncing on the crossbar!His goal was selected as the 72nd greatest sporting moment ever by the Channel 4 programme 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. The goal was also ranked 7th in The Times newspaper's list of the 50 most important goals in football history.[2] His goal against Plymouth Argyle was number 15 in the 20 Goals That Shook the World on ITV4. The Puma boots with which he scored the goal were donated to the National Football Museum in 2014.[5] Despite his brief fame, this was the last of just three matches Glass played at Carlisle, who were unable to sign him on a permanent basis. Glass spent time at several other clubs, including Oxford United and Brentford, before moving to non-league clubs, and then quitting football altogether. He reportedly scored six goals two weeks running whilst playing Sunday league football in Bournemouth, playing as a striker. He wrote an autobiography, entitled One Hit Wonder.[6] Author Gabriel Kuhn described Glass's fame by saying:[7] Football allows for magic experiences and incredible personal stories, such as when no-name goalkeeper Jimmy Glass saved Carlisle United from relegation to amateur football (sic) in 1999 with a last-minute goal, only to disappear into anonymity again shortly after.Glass retired from professional football at the age of 27, and became an IT salesman.[8] He later became a taxi driver in Dorset.[9] In a 2013 BBC interview Glass stated: "It is quite tough because some go on to fame and fortune and some go on to driving a cab and living a normal life like me. It is quite difficult to understand your place in life from being this guy who will never be forgotten to being the guy worrying about your next bill. The goal was an amazing part of my life and is there to be enjoyed, and I will until people get bored of me. Someone on Saturday will be a hero and someone will be a villain. It is an incredible feeling."[10] In October 2011, it was announced that Glass joined Poole Town as the new goalkeeping coach, working on a voluntary basis.[11] He also had a job in hospitality at AFC Bournemouth.[12] In 2016, he returned to football as Player Liaison Officer with Premier League club Bournemouth.[13] On 4 July 2023, Glass was appointed general manager at Wimborne Town.[14] A letterhead is the heading at the top of a sheet of letter paper (stationery). It consists of a name, address, logo or trademark, and sometimes a background pattern. Many companies and individuals prefer to create a letterhead template in a word processor or other software application. That generally includes the same information as pre-printed stationery but at lower cost. Letterhead can then be printed on stationery or plain paper, as needed, on a local output device or sent electronically. Letterheads are generally printed by either the offset or letterpress methods. In most countries outside North America, company letterheads are printed A4 in size (210 mm x 297 mm).[1] In North America, the letter size is typically 8.5 x 11 inches (215 x 280 mm). Although modern technology makes letterheads very easy to imitate, they continue to be used as evidence of authenticity.[2][3] This publishing-related article is a stub.

The 2023 Nigerian Senate elections in Benue State will be held on 25 February 2023, to elect the 3 federal Senators from Benue State, one from each of the state's three senatorial districts. The elections will coincide with the 2023 presidential election, as well as other elections to the Senate and elections to the House of Representatives; with state elections being held two weeks later. Primaries were held between 4 April and 9 June 2022. In the previous Senate elections, none of the three incumbent senators were returned, with longtime Senator David Mark (PDP-South) retiring whilst Barnabas Andyar Gemade (SDP-North-East) and George Akume (APC-North-West) were defeated in their re-election bids. In the South district, Patrick Abba Moro retained the seat for the PDP with 49% of the vote; the PDP gained the other two seats as Gabriel Suswam unseated Gemade with 53% in the North-East while Akume was defeated in the North-West by Emmanuel Yisa Orker-Jev with 57% of the vote. These results were a part of a wider shift back towards the PDP in Benue as PDP presidential nominee Atiku Abubakar narrowly won the state after Buhari had won it in 2015 and the PDP won seven House of Representatives seats. Similarly, Governor Samuel Ortom (PDP) won re-election by over 10% and the PDP won a majority in the House of Assembly. Gabriel Suswam PDP To be determined To be determined The Benue North-East Senatorial District covers the local government areas of Katsina-Ala, Konshisha, Kwande, Logo, Vandeikya, Ukum, and Ushongo. The district is often referred to as "Zone A" and is also noted for its ethnic Tiv majority. The incumbent Gabriel Suswam (PDP), who was elected with 52.6% of the vote in 2019, is seeking re-election. On the primary date, seven candidates contested a direct primary that ended with Emmanuel Memga Udende—former MHR for Katsina-Ala/Ukum/Logo—winning the nomination after results showed him defeating Terlumun Akputu by a 40% margin.[13] On the primary date, an indirect primary ended with Suswam's renomination as he was unopposed.[20] In December 2022, reporting from The Punch stated that while Udende and Suswam were the two frontrunners, Torngee Malu (LP) could obtain a significant share of the vote total.[21] Emmanuel Yisa Orker-Jev PDP To be determined To be determined The Benue North-West Senatorial District covers the local government areas of Buruku, Gboko, Gwer East, Gwer West, Guma, Makurdi, and Tarka. The district is often referred to as "Zone B" and is also noted for its ethnic Tiv majority. The incumbent Emmanuel Yisa Orker-Jev (PDP), who was elected with 56.5% of the vote in 2019, is retiring from the Senate. On 30 May, a direct primary that ended with Titus Zam defeating two other candidates in a landslide. Weeks before the primary, Orker-Jev declined to run for re-election in favour of outgoing Governor Samuel Ortom's senatorial ambition. On the primary date, Ortom was nominated unopposed at the venue in Makurdi. After the vote, Ortom thanked the people of the district and pledged to continue good representation.[25][20] In review of the campaign in December 2022, reporting from The Nation observed regional elements to the election as Ortom's feud with PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu reflected on their native communities as Ortom is a Jemgba Tiv while Ayu is a Minda Tiv. Another key factor noted was the ability of Ortom to use the power of his state government to help campaigning.[26] In a piece later that month from The Punch, reporting indicated that Ortom had met with several Minda Tiv community leaders to gain their support while Zam had been hindered by the rising candidacy of Mark Gbillah (LP)—a MHR who, like Zam, originates from Gwer West LGA.[21] A piece from The Africa Report in January also noted regional sentiments and Gwer West vote splitting but focused more so on the Ortom versus former Governor George Akume dynamic. An analyst claimed "Zam is Akume's candidate" and thus the election was labeled effectively a contest between Ortom and Akume.[27] In the fortnight prior to the election, the election came to national attention when Ortom endorsed Peter Obi in the presidential election on 17 February 2023.[28] While it was notable as he became the first incumbent governor to endorse Obi, in terms of the senatorial election, Ortom became in danger of internal PDP sanction due to the endorsement. Despite this threat, Ortom claimed that he was "sacrifice [his] senatorial ambition" for Obi's campaign.[29] Pundits noted the oddity of Ortom endorsing Obi while competing against Gbillah in addition to the rising popularity of APC gubernatorial nominee Hyacinth Alia.[30] Patrick Abba Moro PDP To be determined To be determined The Benue South Senatorial District covers the local government areas of Ado, Agatu, Apa, Obi, Ogbadibo, Ohimini, Oju, Okpokwu, and Otukpo. The district is often referred to as "Zone C" and is also noted for its population of predominantly ethnic Idoma and Igede peoples. The incumbent Patrick Abba Moro (PDP), who was elected with 48.6% of the vote in 2019, is seeking re-election. On 30 May, a direct primary that ended with activist Daniel Onjeh defeating four candidates in a landslide. In Onjeh's acceptance speech, he called on the party to unite behind him as its nominee.[22][31] On May 28, four candidates contested an indirect primary that ended with Moro winning renomination after results showed him defeating Hassan Anthony Saleh by a significant margin.[34] In a December 2022 campaign analysis article, The Punch labeled Moro as the frontrunner while Onjeh and Joseph Ojobo (LP) were noted as other major candidates.[21] The 2019 World Taekwondo Grand Slam is the 3rd edition of the World Taekwondo Grand Slam series taking place from 18 to 20 December in Wuxi, China.[1][2] Non Seeded Athletes are as follows: The competition was held from 18 December to 20 December.

He was left out the matchday squad for the game against Italy, but was an unused substitute in the match verses Serbia.[10] He made his debut for the team in August 2012 as a substitute, in a 2-0 loss to Iceland in Reykjavik.[11] Empire Conyngham was a 1,408 GRT cargo ship that was built as Marie in 1899 by Neptun AG, Rostock, Germany for German owners. A sale in 1923 saw her renamed Norburg. She was sold to Latvia in 1925 and renamed Gauja, serving until 1941 when she was captured by the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic Sea. In 1945, she was seized by the Allies, passed to the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT) and was renamed Empire Conyngham. In 1946, she was scuttled with a cargo of obsolete bombs. The ship was built in 1899 by Neptun AG, Rostock.[1] The ship was 241 feet 5 inches (73.58 m) long, with a beam of 36 feet 1 inch (11.00 m) and a depth of 16 feet 9 inches (5.11 m). She was assessed at 1,501 GRT, 895 NRT.[2] The ship was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine, which had cylinders of 18 inches (46 cm), 30+1⁄2 inches (77 cm) and 48 inches (120 cm) diameter by 33+1⁄8 inches (84 cm) stroke. The engine was built by Neptun AG.[2] Marie was built for the Flensburger Dampfschiff Gesellschaft, Flensburg. She was operated under the management of H Schuldt.[3] In 1923, she was sold to Ozean Dampschiff AG and was renamed Norburg. In 1925, she was sold to the Latvian Government and was renamed Gauja.[1] Her port of registry was Riga and the Code Letters TBDP were allocated. Gauja was operated under the management of Valsts Kuģu Pārvalde.[2] By 1935, her code letters had been changed to YLCZ and the ship was assessed at 1,408 GRT, 829 NRT.[4] On 8 June 1941, Gauja was captured by the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic Sea. She was renamed Friedrich and operated by Otto Wiggers, Rostock. Friedrich was captured by the Allies in May 1945. She was passed to the MoWT and renamed Empire Conyngham.[1] Her port of registry was changed to London and the Code Letters GKWN were allocated.[5] On 18 June 1949, Empire Conyngham departed Dartmouth, Devon with a cargo of obsolete bombs. She was escorted by HMS Burghead Bay. On 20 June, she was scuttled in the Bay of Biscay (47°52′N 8°51′W﻿ / ﻿47.867°N 8.850°W﻿ / 47.867; -8.850).[6] Urfa butter (Turkish: Urfa yaği), also called Urfa clarified butter (Turkish: Urfa sadeyaği), is a type of clarified butter made from sheep's milk that is distinct to the Turkish city of Urfa and the surrounding region.[1]: 1–2 It is produced from the milk of the Üveysi sheep pastured on the southern outskirts of the Karaca Dağ and on the Tektek Dağ.[1]: 1–2 [2]: 9 The plants growing in these hilly regions form part of the sheep's diet and impart a slightly distinct flavor to their milk.[1]: 1–2 Like other sheep's milk products, Urfa butter has a high percentage of milk fat.[1]: 1–2 Besides Urfa itself, Urfa butter is also made in other parts of Şanlıurfa province, such as Siverek, Viranşehir, Ceylanpınar, and Harran.[1]: 1–2 There is no single, standardized production method for Urfa butter, so its composition and fat content can vary somewhat depending on the sample.[2]: 12 The sheep are milked in the spring, and the milk is boiled.[1]: 1–2 Then the milk is churned to produce butter, which is then melted to separate the butterfat from the milk solids and water.[2]: 9 Today the clarifying process is done by machine, but in the past it was done manually in containers made from animal skins.[1]: 1–2 Zygonopus whitei Trichopetalum whitei, common name Luray Caverns blind cave millipede, is a rare troglobitic (obligate cavernicolous) millipede of the upper Potomac River drainage in four Virginia counties and three West Virginia counties. It has been recorded from 12 caves across this range, including the Luray Caverns where it was first discovered and described. T. whitei is an eyeless, white (unpigmented) millipede. In common with all trichopetalids, it has rows of very elongate segmental setae extending in rows along the dorsal side. Proper identification requires microscopic examination and dissection of the gonopods (copulatory apparatus) by a specialist skilled in millipede identification. T. whitei is a troglobite and occurs only in caves, especially occurring on damp, rotting wood. T. whitei is presumably omnivorous, although nothing is known of its feeding preferences. Feeding is presumed to consist of picking up or scraping material from the substrate with the mouthparts then grinding with the mandibles. The species is recorded from caves in the upper Potomac River drainage in Virginia (Augusta, Page, Rockingham, and Shenandoah Counties) and West Virginia (Hardy, Grant, and Pendleton Counties). However, if another cave millipede, T. weyeriensis, intergrades with T. whitei in Pendleton County and these two species are synonymous (as some workers believe), then the range of T. whitei would also extend into Greenbrier, Monroe and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia. Nothing is known of the life history of this species. In related species, the male secretes sperm from pores on the coxae of the second legs into coxal sacs on the post-gonopodal legs. The secretions from the coxal sacs then form the seminal fluid into a spermatophore which is then transferred to the cyphopods of the female during mating. T. whitei is considered globally vulnerable to extinction by NatureServe, with populations in West Virginia considered critically imperiled, and Virginia populations imperiled.[1] T. whitei is designated as a Regional Forester Sensitive Species in the Monongahela National Forest in the Eastern Region of the Forest Service.[2] T. whitei was first described as Zygonopus whitei by Ryder in 1881.[3] It became Trichopetalum whitei with the synonymy of Zygonopus with Trichopetalum by Shear in 1972.[4] Causey has suggested that Trichopetalum weyeriensis may be a subspecies of Trichopetalum whitei rather than a distinct species.[5] Gaber Abdelaty Abouzeid (20 June 1954 – 15 August 2020) was an Egyptian volleyball player. He competed in the 1976 and 1984 Summer Olympics.[3] This biographical article relating to volleyball in Egypt is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it. Willis Lee Barnes (October 22, 1900 – March 22, 1976) was an American football, basketball, track and field, and boxing coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of New Mexico from 1942 to 1946, compiling a record of 45–35–10. Barnes was also the head basketball coach at New Mexico from 1941 to 1943, tallying a mark of 12–30. Barnes came to the University of New Mexico in 1937 as an assistant football coach.[1] # denotes interim head coach Fionn Regan (born 1981) is an Irish folk musician and singer-songwriter. Born and raised in Bray, Regan came to prominence with the release of his debut studio album, The End of History in 2006. He had been releasing extended plays for six years on independent record labels prior to the album's release. Regan's second studio album, The Shadow of an Empire was released in 2010 to positive reviews and his third studio album, 100 Acres of Sycamore, was released in 2011. His fourth studio album, The Bunkhouse Vol. 1: Anchor Black Tattoo, was released in 2012. Among the accolades Regan has received nominations for the Choice Music Prize in Ireland, the Mercury Prize in the United Kingdom and the Shortlist Music Prize in the United States. Regan has cited Bob Dylan and Neil Young as influences on his music and has been referred to by Lucinda Williams as "his generation's answer to Bob Dylan". Regan's early releases included the single "Little Miss Drunk", a 7", and two EPs titled Hotel Room and Reservoir, which were released on a small indie label, Anvil Records. He also self-released a 'tour only' EP called Campaign Button. Following these releases, in 2006 Regan signed to former Cocteau Twin Simon Raymonde's independent record label, Bella Union in the UK, resulting in Regan's debut album The End of History being released on 7 August 2006 to major critical acclaim. Regan was hailed as a leader of the new 'Brit' folk movement, The Guardian saying "Folk has a new Pied Piper."[1] Following his UK success, Regan was subsequently signed by the American label Lost Highway Records. The End of History was released in the US on 10 July 2007. The End of History was produced by Regan himself (mixing the album with Simon Raymonde). Mojo magazine gave the album four stars in a review that dubbed the disc "a debut that oozes rare confidence, startling maturity and originality".[citation needed] The album received a slew of 4 and 5 star reviews from publications including The Times and The Guardian.[2][3] Regan has toured worldwide and played many festivals around the world including the Glastonbury Festival, XPoNential Music Festival in Camden, New Jersey, Electric Picnic (Ireland), Summercase and Benicassim (Spain), Bestival (Isle of Wight) ACL (Austin, Texas) Hardly Strictly Bluegrass (San Francisco) and Laneways Festival Australia. He was invited to perform with Lucinda Williams on her 2007 tour, Williams saying at the Irving Plaza NY concert that Fionn is "his generation's answer to Bob Dylan".[4] Around this time, Regan was photographed by Annie Leibovitz for Vanity Fair magazine's prestigious music portfolio.[5] In July 2008, Regan was invited to perform as part of a filmed live concert, "Liam Clancy: Live The Bitter End". During this concert in honour of Liam Clancy, he shared the stage with Clancy, Tom Paxton, Shane MacGowan and Odetta. This was Odetta's last filmed performance before her death. This was also Liam Clancy's final filmed concert. Clancy had first risen to fame as part of The Clancy Brothers, the group which first sparked the Irish folk revival of the 1960s.[6] In 2008 Regan recorded a follow-up album to The End of History with producer Ethan Johns (son of the legendary 60's producer Glyn Johns) for the Lost Highway label, who refused to release it. The album remains unreleased and Regan has referred to this album as The Red Tapes.[7][8] The following year (2009) Regan retreated to County Wicklow, Ireland to record what would become The Shadow of an Empire without any record label involvement or intrusion. Jeff Barrett of Heavenly Records was one of the first to hear the completed album and quickly signed him up.[9] Regan released the album to critical acclaim on 8 February 2010,[10] achieving several four-star reviews from several publications, including Mojo, Uncut, Q, Hot Press, Financial Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The Independent.[11] In 2010, Regan gave a special performance in Dylan Thomas' boathouse in Laugharne, Wales.[12] The following year in August, Regan released his third studio album, 100 Acres of Sycamore, with the track "Dogwood Blossom" featuring prominently in Shane Meadows' TV drama This Is England '88. Regan performed at the Eurosonic Festival in 2012 when Ireland was the "Spotlight Country".[13] On 17 August 2012, Hot Press announced that Regan had completed his fourth studio album, The Bunkhouse Vol. 1: Anchor Black Tattoo. The album was released on 7 September and Regan described the album by saying: "you can call it folk but I feel in a lot of ways it's like an Irish punk album, in that it's pure, it's stripped down." The album's themes range from the Irish Sea ("Mizen to Malin") to "the hallucinatory" ("St. Anthony's Fire").[14] In April 2017, Regan released his fifth studio album The Meetings of the Waters via independent label Abbey Records under his imprint 'Tsuneni Ai'. The album maintains Regan's traditional folk influences but explores a theme of electronica. "His first album for five years is still a folk record at heart, but one swathed in electronic orchestrations".[15] Perceived by many to be the "Regan's best work since his award winning debut", the album received numerous four-star reviews including: The Guardian, Irish Times, Thank Folk for That, and was nominated for the RTÉ Music Choice Award in 2018. To support the lead single, also titled "The Meetings of the Waters", Regan released a music video starring actor Cillian Murphy. His single "Be Good or Be Gone" has been used in the television dramas Grey's Anatomy, Nearly Famous, and Skins and "Dogwood Blossom" featured in hit series' This Is England '88 and Normal People. His song "Put A Penny In The Slot" has been offered as an iTunes Free Download of the Week. The Welsh actor Rhys Ifans has a tattoo of Regans' lyrics "Be good or be gone".[8] Ellie Goulding and Andrea Corr have been quoted in the press saying they are fans of Regan's music.[16][17] Regan's song "Put a Penny in the Slot" was selected to be included on a special compilation album created by IASCA and FMC in partnership with Culture Ireland to present the gift of music from Ireland to dignitaries the Queen and President Obama and their international press corps travelling with them during their individual visits to Ireland in 2011.[18] Bon Iver's track "00000 Million" on their album "22, A Million", features a sample of the line "The days have no numbers" from Regan's track "Abacus". Regan was nominated for two Meteor Music Awards (Best Male and Best Newcomer) in 2006 [citation needed] and The End of History was nominated for Irish Album of the Year at the Choice Music Prize,[19] and was one of the twelve shortlisted albums for the 2007 Mercury Music Prize.[20] He was nominated for the 2008 Shortlist Prize, the US equivalent of the Mercury Prize.[21] In 2009, Regan was invited to speak and made an honorary member of the Trinity College Literary Society, the chairman saying "In his music, Mr. Regan has done more than many artists to erode the boundaries between music and literature, with his lyrics always possessing the most beautiful poetry."[22] Archaeology, Ethnology & Anthropology of Eurasia (Russian: Археология, Этнография и Антропология Евразии) is a bilingual peer-reviewed academic journal covering anthropological and archaeological studies on Eurasia. It was established in 2000 by the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.[1] Since January 2008, the institute publishes it in association with Elsevier.[2][3] The journal is abstracted and indexed in: Since its establishment, Anatoly Pantelyevich Derevyanko is the editor-in-chief of the journal.[1][7] Pavel Andreievich Chekov (Russian: Павел Андреевич Чехов) is a fictional character in the Star Trek universe. Walter Koenig portrayed Chekov in the second and third seasons of the original Star Trek series and the first seven Star Trek films. Anton Yelchin portrayed the character in the 2009 Star Trek reboot film and two sequels, Star Trek Into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond. Both Koenig and Yelchin were born to Russian parents, but grew up in the United States, and both affected Russian accents for their roles. Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry wanted to include a younger cast member to appeal to teenage audiences. With a second season of Star Trek to be produced, Roddenberry interviewed Walter Koenig on the recommendation of director Joseph Pevney.[1]: 345 After casting Koenig, Roddenberry wrote a letter to Mikhail Zimyanin, editor of Pravda,[1]: 344 informing him of the introduction of a Russian character, and an NBC press release announcing the character at the time stated that it was in response to a Pravda article, condemning the show for having no Russian characters.[2][3] The existence of such a Pravda article is disputed. Roddenberry also acknowledged that the character was in response to the popularity of The Monkees' Davy Jones. Koenig always denied the "Russian origin" story and affirmed that his character was added in response to the popularity of The Monkees, and the character's hairstyle and appearance are a direct reference to this.[4][5] Roddenberry had previously mentioned, in a memo to his casting director, a desire to have someone reminiscent of one of The Beatles or Monkees on the show.[1]: 345 Koenig's modest height, eyes, thick eyebrows, boyish face, and smile were all strikingly evocative of the lone British "Monkee" who captivated millions of pre-teen girls. Early attempts were made to style Koenig's brown hair similar to that of Jones too. Wigs were used in a couple of early episodes but not in others, which reveals a stage of experimentation to attentive viewers. Eventually, a final look for Koenig's hair length and fullness was reached and used consistently thereafter. After Paramount Television signed Koenig to a contract because of the number of fan letters he received as Chekov, Roddenberry wrote in another memo "Kirk and Spock and the others actually seem rather 'middle aged' to the large youthful segment of our audience. We badly need a young man aboard the Enterprise—we need youthful attitudes and perspectives. Chekov can be used potently here".[6] In actuality, Koenig is only five years younger than co-stars Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. The episode "Amok Time", which was the first episode broadcast during the second season, was Chekov's first television appearance ("Catspaw", the first episode shot with the Chekov character, would be broadcast a month later to roughly coincide with Halloween). Because of budgetary constraints, the character did not appear in the animated Star Trek.[1]: 422 Pavel Andreievich Chekov was born in 2245 and is a young and naïve ensign who first appears on-screen in the original series’ second season as the Enterprise's navigator. According to Roddenberry, he is "an extraordinarily capable young man—almost Spock's equal in some areas. An honor graduate of the Space Academy."[6] Chekov also substitutes for Mr. Spock at the science officer station when necessary. His promotion to lieutenant for Star Trek: The Motion Picture brings with it his transfer as the ship's tactical officer and chief of security. During his tour of Duty on the Enterprise, Chekov lost his mind on three occasions: in "Day of the Dove" Chekov was implanted with false memories and driven to violence by a non-corporeal alien entity; in "And the Children Shall Lead", Chekov was exposed to mind control by a group of children who had been given powers by a non-corporeal being; and in "The Tholian Web" Chekov became violently insane following exposure to interspace. Furthermore, in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Chekov was subject to mind control after being implanted with a juvenile Ceti eel. A running gag on Star Trek is that whenever Chekov gets into personal combat with opponents stronger than him, he loses the fight: "The Trouble with Tribbles" with Klingons or "The Gamesters of Triskelion" with the gladiator-like slaves/thralls. In "Spectre of the Gun" he is shot and killed in the fantasy but survives only because he was thinking of a beautiful fantasy woman. He also likes the beautiful female androids in "I, Mudd". By the events of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Chekov is executive officer aboard the USS Reliant. In that film, Khan Noonien Singh uses a creature that wraps itself around Chekov's cerebral cortex to control him and his captain. Chekov overcomes the creature's mind control and serves as Enterprise tactical officer in the film's climactic battle. A common myth about Star Trek is that Khan recognizing Chekov in the film is a continuity error because "Space Seed", with the villain, was broadcast before Koenig's casting.[7] Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text calls this "the apparent gaffe notorious throughout Star Trek fandom".[8] Although Chekov does not appear in "Space Seed", "Catspaw"—with the character—has an earlier stardate.[7] Koenig joked that Khan remembers Chekov from the episode after he takes too long in a restroom Khan wants to use.[9] Chekov is an accomplice in Kirk's theft of the Enterprise to rescue Spock in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, but is exonerated in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. He serves as navigator aboard the Enterprise-A during the events of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. The character's final film appearance is as a guest aboard the Enterprise-B on its maiden voyage in Star Trek Generations. Chekov is mentioned in the series finale of Star Trek: Picard as being deceased in a broadcast by his son, Anton, who is serving as the president of the Federation. Koenig insisted that the character be called Anton as a tribute to the late Anton Yelchin, who inherited his role as Chekov for the J. J. Abrams reboot films. Spinoff novels show a continued career path, but these are not considered canon in the Star Trek universe. Novels written by William Shatner detail that Chekov reaches the rank of admiral, and even serves as Commander in Chief of Starfleet. The 2009 Star Trek film creates an alternate timeline in the franchise.[10] In this timeline, Anton Yelchin's portrayal presents Chekov as a 17-year-old prodigy whose mathematical ability proves instrumental in a few events within the film, and whose accent provides some of the film's comic relief. In the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, Chekov finds himself promoted to chief engineer after Scotty resigns. When Kirk orders him to put on a red shirt, a brief sting is heard as a closeup shows Chekov's nervous face, playing on the reputation of redshirts in the franchise as much as the character's shock regarding his sudden promotion. The third film, Star Trek Beyond, was Yelchin's final appearance as Chekov, the film seeing Chekov accompanying Kirk after the entire crew are marooned on an uncharted planet following the destruction of the Enterprise, forcing them to destroy the last of the Enterprise to escape a trap and later work with the rest of the senior staff to restart a long-lost Starfleet ship to escape the planet and defeat a plan to attack the Federation. Yelchin was crushed to death by his 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee on June 19, 2016, little more than a month before the scheduled release of Star Trek Beyond on July 22, 2016. All filming had been completed and post-production had started. A dedication to Yelchin's memory was inserted into the credits. J. J. Abrams, producer of the reboot trilogy and director of its first two films, has stated that the role will not be recast for future sequels, implying the character of Chekov will be written out in future films. Walter Koenig reprised his role as Chekov 12 years after Star Trek Generations in the fan-created series New Voyages episode "To Serve All My Days". Andy Bray portrayed a younger Chekov in that episode. Koenig reprised the character again in Star Trek: Renegades as 143-year-old Admiral Chekov, the newly appointed head of Section 31. He has stated that should there be a sequel, he would reprise Chekov and then retire from the role. He also returned as Chekov in the online miniseries Star Trek: Of Gods and Men. In scientific illustrator Jenny Parks' 2017 book Star Trek Cats, Chekov is depicted as a Russian Blue.[11][12][13] In 2018, The Wrap placed Chekov as 21st out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the Star Trek franchise prior to Star Trek: Discovery.[14] In 2016, Chekov was ranked as the 30th most important character of Starfleet within the Star Trek science fiction universe by Wired magazine, out of 100 characters.[15] In 2018, Comic Book Resources ranked Chekov the 22nd best member of Starfleet.[16] Spitakashen (Armenian: Սպիտակաշեն) or Aghkend (Azerbaijani: Ağkənd) is a village in the Khojavend District of Azerbaijan, in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The village had an Armenian majority in 1989.[2] The village's name means "white village" in both Armenian and Azerbaijani. During the Soviet period, the village was a part of the Martuni District of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Historical heritage sites in and around the village include the 13th-century Holy Savior Church (Armenian: Սուրբ Ամենափրկիչ Եկեղեցի, romanized: Surb Amenaprkich Yekeghetsi) and a 13th-century cemetery.[1] The population is mainly engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry. As of 2015, the village has a municipal building, a house of culture, a secondary school, and a medical centre.[1] The village had 437 inhabitants in 2005,[3] and 453 inhabitants in 2015.[1] This Khojavend District location article is a stub.

College Green (aka Abingdon Green,[1] formally known as Abingdon Street Gardens) is a public park in the City of Westminster in Central London.[2] It is east of Westminster Abbey including Westminster Abbey Gardens and across a road from the gardens of the Houses of Parliament.[2] The gardens are not enclosed and are accessible at all times.[2] For many months of 2019, during the Brexit deadlock, it exclusively hosted TV broadcasts and radio and media interviews. The park is a common place for television reporters to interview Members of Parliament.[3] Henry Moore's bronze sculpture Knife Edge Two Piece 1962–65 is in the gardens.[2] The gardens are a roof to a two-storey underground car park constructed from 1963 to 1964.[4] The site was originally a tidally flooded bank of the River Thames separated from the College Garden of Westminster Abbey by a medieval wall with a watergate. Its name refers to the collegiate church of Westminster Abbey, which includes Westminster School. The Uhlandshöhe is a hill in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The Uhlandshöhe in Stuttgart is a hill on the eastern edge of the city centre. The name of the hill was originally the Ameisenberg ("Ant Hill"), but in 1862 the name of a park was given to the whole area. Together with the districts of Gaisburg, Berg, Gablenberg, Ostheim, Frauenkopf, Stöckach and Gänsheide, it has been part of the inner city district of Stuttgart-Ost since 2001. The Uhlandshöhe lies roughly in the triangle formed by the city centre, the historic quarter of Bad Cannstatt (on the River Neckar) and the Gänsheide. 48°47′03″N 9°11′46″E﻿ / ﻿48.78417°N 9.19611°E﻿ / 48.78417; 9.19611 This Baden-Württemberg location article is a stub.

Vedrana has been the director of marketing agency Fresca Viva Pty Ltd since 2007.[2] Grbovic was born in Belgrade, although she and her family would later move to Australia. She went on to appear in fashion shows in Belgrade, Perth, Los Angeles, Greece, and Italy. She won the titles of Miss Prom 2004 and Miss Earth Australia (W.A.) 2005 and has appeared in many television shows in Serbia, as well as music video clips and television advertisements. She is a professionally trained dancer and actress, although she graduated with a degree in marketing and advertising. In 2006, then a Curtin University student, Vedrana was named Miss World Serbia & Montenegro.[3][4] Vedrana is an active contributor and participant in the Serbian community events in Australia. She is actively engaged in and supports community events organised by the Serbian Orthodox Church.[5][6] Vedrana also contributed to implementation of Hopman Cup in 2008.[7] Thomas Henshaw (1731–1810) was an English hatter from Oldham, Lancashire. He bequeathed the funds for the foundation of The Blue Coat School in Oldham and Henshaws Society for Blind People. Henshaw was born in 1731 at Prestbury, Cheshire, one of seven children. His parents, John and Martha Henshaw, owned and farmed a small estate in Butts Lane, Prestbury. Henshaw's father died when he was two years old. Henshaw was the youngest surviving child in his family. At an early age Henshaw was put to work with his brother Henry on a farm in Derbyshire. He subsequently left his brother in possession of the farm, and around 1755 he became an apprentice to John Fletcher, a hat manufacturer in Oldham. After serving his apprenticeship, Thomas left Oldham for Manchester, where he became part-owner of a dye works. Around 1770, Henshaw returned to Oldham and entered into a partnership with his old master, John Fletcher. His brother, Henry Henshaw, joined the partnership a couple of years later. In time Thomas and Henry Henshaw set up their own business in the hatting trade and established a manufacturing works on what is now Henshaw Street in Oldham. The Henshaws "were remarkable for their habits of industry and frugality" and as a result of their "almost unceasing attention to business" their hat works became the largest in the district, with about 300 workers. They became importers of beaver and fur, which were used extensively in the hatting trade, and developed other subsidiary interests. From an initial capital of £2,000, the Henshaws eventually accumulated a fortune of £154,000. The Henshaws were considerate towards their workers. They established schools for the education of the workers' children, and they encouraged their attendance at church. They were liberal benefactors of local charities and undertakings, making regular donations to the Manchester Infirmary and the Lunatic Hospital, and were associated with the construction of new roads. The brothers were also the first people to establish Sunday Schools in Lancashire. They hired schoolmasters, and reading and writing were taught on Sunday. This would have been the only formal education that most of the children ever received. In 1754, Thomas Henshaw married Hannah Taylor. Their only child, Henry, was born the following year and died at age ten. Hannah Henshaw died in 1775. In 1799, at the age of 68, Thomas Henshaw married Sarah Mayers. From then until his death in 1810, Henshaw lived either at Higher Groves or at his wife's house at Hamer Hill in Blackley. Henshaw had a severe attack of paralysis in 1800, and after that was depressed and irresponsible at times. Despite his state of health, he often rode on horseback in the neighborhood of Blackley, and he continued to deal with his business at Hargreaves Works. His main preoccupation, however, was the framing of his will.[citation needed] In 1807, Thomas made his will, which bequeathed £20,000 (£1.7 million as of 2024)[1] to establish a charity school in Oldham and £20,000 for the foundation of an asylum for the blind in Manchester. In a codicil dated May 1808, he appointed trustees for both the school and the asylum.[2] In the early morning of Sunday 4 March 1810, Henshaw was found drowned in a reservoir near his works. He was 79. At the inquest, held the following day, medical evidence was given that he had been subject to attacks of mental derangement. The verdict brought in by the jury was that he had drowned himself, "and that the Cause of his having so drowned himself was his insanity." Henshaw was buried on 10 March in Prestwich Church.[3] His widow contested Henshaw's will on the grounds that he had made it whilst mentally unbalanced. The matter was referred to the Court of Chancery and 23 years later the court ruled that the will was valid.[4][5] This freed the funds in Henshaw's estate to be applied to founding the school and asylum, and this was done.

He attended St. Vincent's C.B.S. Glasnevin. Leaving secondary school in 1933 he joined the well-known Dublin bakers, Peter Kennedy & Sons as a trainee ledger clerk. He had been interested in acting and drama from an early age and he joined the A.O.H. Players in 1934 and played with many of the leading amateur drama groups in the city in the following years. In 1936 while performing in the pantomime ‘Jack & the Beanstalk’ with the Fr. Matthew Players he created what was to become one of his favourite characters – John Joe Mahockey from Ballyslapdashamuckery – an astute countryman or Culchie to use the Dublin expression, who wore a flat cap with an enormous peak, navy blue suit, white shirt, red tie and a large pair of brown hobnailed boots. Jack was a first cousin of the Irish portrait painter Leo Whelan. He performed initially in the Queens Theater and while appearing there he was recommended to Noel Purcell, then a Theatre Royal star. Shortly afterwards he began performing and writing scripts for the weekly variety shows the Royal was renowned for. He eventually left Kennedys bakery in 1945 to work full-time in The Theatre Royal where he had been appointed house manager and press officer. That Christmas he played in the Pantomime ‘Mother Goose’ with Noel Purcell, Eddie Byrne, Frankie Blowers, Sean Mooney and Pauline Forbes whose father Dick wrote the show. The show also featured The Royalettes and the Theatre’s orchestra conducted by Jimmy Campbell. In the five weeks run it was seen by 231,000 citizens. It was described by Dublin Theatre critic John Finegan as ‘Dublin’s greatest panto’. He performed in the Theatre Royal regularly up to the late 1940s when theatrical work in the city took a downturn. He returned to the Royal in the early 1950s and performed regularly until its closure in 1962. In the Royal Theatre's 1951/52 offering, Robinson Crusoe which opened on 23 December, the production featured Eddie Byrne as Captain Hook (a bad bad pirate), Jack Cruise and Harry Bailey as Wette and Windee (two old salts) and Noel Purcell as Ma Crusoe (a merry widow). With eighteen named players plus the Royalettes and assorted specialty acts, the eleven scene presentation took the Irish Clipper to Neptune’s Domain and the Island of Golden Palms, thereby allowing Ma Crusoe to discover the Lollipop Tree. He set up his own import-export agency until a new opportunity presented itself. In 1948, Sir William Heygate Edmund Colborne "Billy" Butlin opened his Irish holiday camp in Mosney Co.Meath. Three years later Jack was offered the summer variety season there and for the following eight years he produced 80 different shows for the patrons. The Olympia Theatre closed between February 1964 and August 1964. It had been sold to a group of London-Irish publicans who had an idea of converting it into a cabaret-restaurant. The Corporation refused and Jack Cruise, Lorcan Bourke, Richard Hallinan and founder of The Dublin Theatre Festival, Brendan Smith took over the Theater on a six months lease. The first show was a revue "Holiday Hayride" with Jack Cruise which did better business than any other show in the history of the Olympia up until that time.[2] Some of the pantomimes he directed at the Olympia were : Jack Cruise on the Late Late Show 1976. Jack Cruise was one of the last performers to survive the impact of T.V. Managing the successful Holiday Hayride productions throughout the 60's &70's.His final production was the Panto Aladdin at the Olympia Theatre Christmas 1978.In 1979 he had agreed to produce and appear in Summer revue in Butlins Mosney he passed away on May 1979 .As with the old theatre adage 'The show must go on ' Dublin Comedian Danny Cummins stood on for Jack and the shows in Butlins went ahead .[3] Stephen J Warner (born May 24, 1978) is a retired American rower who won a world title in 2000 in the lightweight eights.[2] He competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where his team placed ninth in the lightweight coxless four.[1] Warner graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor of science degree in cellular and molecular biology.

The club was founded in 2004, as the Aston Athletics, to play at the Aston Events Centre, which had just been vacated by British Basketball League side Birmingham Bullets. Starting out in English Basketball League Division 3 North, the Athletics enjoyed excellent rookie season which saw them lift the Men's National Shield and finish second in the league, but only on countback in games against winners Plymouth Raiders II. They also reached the semi-finals of the EBL3 Play-offs. The team relocated, from Aston Events Centre to Birmingham Sports Centre in 2006, and, following the dissolution of the Bullets, the club changed its name to Birmingham Athletics to reflect its status as the only National League team representing the city at the time. They subsequently stated their desire to turn professional by becoming the second EBL team (after Coventry Crusaders) to apply for membership of the proposed British Basketball Association (BBA), a league devised to compete with the incumbent British Basketball League as the premier basketball competition in the country, in its inaugural season in 2007–08. However, the BBA never materialized; and this, combined with the BBL and members of the defunct Birmingham Bullets team creating a new Birmingham franchise, the Birmingham Panthers, ultimately prevented Athletics from realizing their professional ambitions. Elite are now primarily a development-focused club; with teams from under 14s to senior, the first team had been based around under-19 players from Elite Academies Basketball League side Bournville College.[1] As of 2019, the academy is now based at James Watt College in the city.[2] The development pathway is completed with a link between the club and Birmingham City University, who compete in the British Universities and Colleges Sport League. The first team and academy is currently coached by Birmingham born, former Euroleague player Steven Hansell.[3][2] As of the 2019–20 season, Elite field teams in the following National League divisions:[4] Note: Flags indicate national team eligibility at FIBA-sanctioned events.
